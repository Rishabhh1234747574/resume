# Packet Tracer (.pkt) Simulation Setup

This repository does not include a `.pkt` file yet. To add one:

1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.x recommended).
2. Create your topology, addressing, and services.
3. Save the file as `project.pkt` in this `packet_tracer/` folder.
4. Export any device configs separately into `configs/` for version control.

Suggested structure:

- `packet_tracer/project.pkt` — the simulation file
- `packet_tracer/configs/` — device startup-configs (optional)
- `packet_tracer/notes.md` — lab instructions and test cases
